The best part - drinking coffee gives you extra boosts to reward you for the hard work you had to do to make it, you can get Speed II for up to 4 whole minutes.
However, drinking coffee gives you one heart of damage




**__How to make coffee__**

The first step to making coffee, is of course to find some coffee cherry seeds. You can either find these seeds in village house chests, or just get them via creative.

Next you'll plant them like you would with any regular seed, this shouldn't take too long to grow.

Once your cherries are fully ripe, you can harvest them. To get the actual coffee bean you just place the coffee cherry in any crafting grid.

Next you will need to dehydrate the coffee bean, you can do this by placing the bean down on a drying rack. This may take a while to complete, so it's recommended to do something else in the meantime. The coffee bean will go through 4 stages on the drying rack, symbolizing how close it is to being fully dehydrated. You can always check the dehydration level by taking the coffee bean out of it, and the dehydration level will be on the coffee bean item.

Now that your bean is fully dehydrated, you can place it in a furnace. This will roast your coffee bean, and make it ready to turn it into coffee powder.

By now you should have a roasted coffee bean, to turn it into coffee powder that you can use in your brewer, you will need a mortar and pestle. These are relatively easy to craft, and you will place your mortar and pestle in a crafting grid alongside your roasted coffee beans. The mortar and pestle has 64 uses before you'll need to get a new one.

Now the last step in making your coffee, is to get a brewer. You'll place your coffee powder in the left most slot, and a water bucket in the right most slot. The bucket provides 1000mB of water, and each brew requires 200mB of water.

If both of these requirements are filled, you should now have a coffee cup, however drinking this by itself will only give you speed II for 2 minutes. You can add upto 4 sugars to the coffee cup by placing the coffee cup and sugar into a crafting grid, each sugar you add will add 30 seconds onto the duration of speed you get

Enjoy bringing your caffeine addiction into minecraft
